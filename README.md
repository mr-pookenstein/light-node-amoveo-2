Amoveo light node
========

This is a light node for the Amoveo cryptocurrency.

[Click this link to download a zip file of the light node](https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/light-node-amoveo/archive/master.zip)

To connect to the mainnet with the light node, open src/js/home.html in a browser.

To connect to the mainnet with the old version of the light node, open src/js/wallet.html in a browser.

here is a list of full nodes that you can download headers from: http://159.89.87.58:8080/peer_scan.html
put the IP address of a full node into the light node so it knows where to download headers from.

This is the IP of a full node that I maintain: 159.89.87.58

It is easier, but less secure, to access the light node from this link http://159.89.87.58:8080/home.html
