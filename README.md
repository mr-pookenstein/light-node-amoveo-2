Amoveo light node - trade explorer
========

this is a fully functional light node specialized for browsing and accepting trades.

To connect to the mainnet with the trade explorer, open src/js/main.html in a browser. Usually just double clicking main.html works.

"My positions" will only show positions that are in a block. until then, you will see an unconfirmed negative balance so you know the trade was successfully sent out. press "show" to see your positions after the unconfirmed balance disappears.

A small percentage of your winnings will pay someone else to settle your trade, so you don't have to do anything after you accept. this is customizable.
